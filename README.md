Predictive data analysis (Linear Regression)

Block 3 - Predictive Analysis of Structured Data using Artificial Intelligence

 C3.1 - Process structured data by creating a processing pipeline using programming libraries such as Scikit-Learn to encode, normalise and slice data to make it interpretable by a machine learning algorithm

C3.2 - Perform predictive analysis on a structured dataset using appropriate supervised machine learning algorithms to automate tasks related to the results of the predictions of these algorithms 

 C3.3 - Develop an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to segment a database into different homogeneous groups or reduce the size of the database in order to be able to understand observations at a granular level and to allow their visualisation 

 C3.4 - Evaluate the predictive performance of machine learning algorithms by determining the influence of different variables in order to improve it to demonstrate its usefulness to business departments, in relation to the processes already established in the organisation
